# How to use:
- The program you want to idle must already be running.
- When you start the program you select the process you want to idle.
- You can select which keys should be pressed and in which interval.
- The program jumps for the keystrokes always briefly in the application and then back to the previous. So you can play 2 games at the same time 
- With F1 you start the fun.

# Disclaimer
This program will probably break several TOS rules.
Use at your own risk.

I created it when New World was released so I could stay ingame during working hours. It was never the goal to make it conform to a certain "quality".

This program needs a complete rework.

The program works. However, I would do a lot of things differently.
